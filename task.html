    <p>Abstract of the book “Winter's Marriages” A French bestseller that rivals “Harry Potter” in the world of steampunk.
        Ophelia is a girl in eyepieces and an old shawl who spends the entire hour reading books in the Archives. And she is also special, because Volodya has the gift of reading the past and manipulating the lights through the mirror. It seems that the expected portal does not match her alliance with Thorn, a self-destructive and cruel representative of the Dragon clan. The girl may leave the ancient ark of Anima and go to the capital of the cold, dark ark, which is known as the Pole. There's a lot of insecurity there and you can't trust anyone. Everything on the Pole has a gateway. Until Ophelia's time, a chimera of intrigue begins, which drags her into a dangerous political game. Now there is an instrument of deadly force that will threaten not only Ophelia’s share, but the future of the whole world.
        “Discover exciting twists and turns in the surroundings of steampunk, airships, masks, illusions and captivating intrigues - it’s all here. The first part of my appetite survives until history continues,” The Wall Street Journal</p>

    <p>Buying “Winter's Ensigns” means plunging into a beautiful alternative reality in steampunk style, sailing off the islands that were lost after the cataclysm, and the skins from these islands—another world that lives by its own laws. At the book “Through the Mirrors. Winter's Ensigns" Christelle Dubos created a master genre weave from sublime fantasy, a secret detective story and romance, adding some psychological prose and a thriller and a mix of feminist narratives. Vibukhova succeeds in transforming the novel into a true masterpiece of contemporary literature, using psychologically complex characters and confusing plot twists. And no, at the end of the cross-mirror roads together with Ophelia, but by no means too much.</p>
